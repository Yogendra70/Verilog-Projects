# AND Gate Module

This project contains a simple 2-input AND gate implemented in Verilog.

## Files

- `and_gate.v` - Verilog module implementing the AND gate.
- `and_gate_tb.v` - Testbench to verify the AND gate behavior.

## How to Simulate in Xilinx Vivado

1. Open Vivado and create a new RTL project.
2. Add `and_gate.v` as a Design Source.
3. Add `and_gate_tb.v` as a Simulation Source.
4. Set `and_gate_tb` as the top module for simulation.
5. Run Behavioral Simulation from the Flow Navigator.
6. Use the waveform viewer to observe signals and verify correct operation.

## About

This project demonstrates basic Verilog design and how to simulate using Xilinx Vivado.
